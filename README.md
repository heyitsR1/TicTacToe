There are surely many optimizations that can be made here, but I wanted to push this version as it really fascinated me—  
**I actually wrote an AI that can play against me!**

While I now understand the minimax algorithm fairly well, it’s still surreal that I could build something like this mostly on my own,  
just by following the lectures and some guidance from the CS50AI course page.

As a kid, I was always amazed by the AI in games and thought it was far too complex for me to ever understand.  
I’m sure some of it *is* incredibly complex—but completing this project has given me hope and confidence that I can keep learning and go even further.

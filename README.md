CS50AI Week 0 Project
Runner.py code is from the course and I didn't code any part of that file
tictactoe.py is where I did most of my code
There are surely many optimizations that can be done here I figured but, 
I wanted to push this as it somewhat fascinated me on how I (yes me) coded an AI to play against me, 
Although I do understand the minimax algorithm quite well, it's still fascinating that I could do this mostly on my own 
following the lectures and hints from the CS50AI course page. 
As a kid playing games, AI in games always fascinated me and I thought they would be so so complex that I would never be able to wrap my head around it, 
I am 100% sure some are, but just completeing the minimax has given me hope that I can continue learning even more!
